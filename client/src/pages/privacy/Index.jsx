              preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and
              collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
              implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
              DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
              not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
              follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
              this privacy notice.
